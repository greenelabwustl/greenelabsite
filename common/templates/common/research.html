            <p>The development of many human abilities, including cognitive,
                motor, sensory, and social functions, are intricately linked.
                Thus, a complete understanding of the development of one
                function relies upon understanding its interactions with the
                others. One way to study these interactions is to examine how
                different parts of the brain communicate to support these
                functions. Brain areas are organized into functional networks,
                and the complex interactions within and among these networks
                can reveal principles about the relationships among numerous
                human abilities in both typical and atypical development.</p>
            <p>Our lab uses the latest tools of cognitive neuroscience to study
                the development of brain network organization and how it
                supports cognitive and sensorimotor development. We use
                multimodal MRI techniques to study typically and atypically
                developing populations to accomplish our goals.</p>

            <p>Studying the whole brain, including the cortex, subcortex, and
                cerebellum, is important for fully understanding the many
                changes that occur over development and alterations seen in
                developmental disorders. Therefore, we use a variety of
                approaches, including resting-state fMRI and structural MRI,
                to interrogate whole-brain function and structure. For example,
                using resting-state fMRI we have identified an approach to best
                capture cortico-subcortical functional connectivity and have
                applied this approach to study its development.</p>

                classification of known characteristics of individuals, such

                individual differences that contribute to each individualâ€™s
                uniqueness. Therefore, we also employ a highly-sampled
                individual-level approach in which we collect large amounts of
                high-quality imaging and behavioral data from each individual.
                Using this approach, we can examine individual-specific brain
                network organization, gaining insight into the distinctiveness

            <p>Tourette syndrome (TS) is a fairly common neurodevelopmental
                disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. Though tics are
                the defining symptoms, TS often involves atypical sensory,
                cognitive, and social functioning as well. We use brain imaging,
                cognitive, and clinical assessments to interrogate the
                mechanisms underlying this complex disorder. We employ both
                cross sectional and longitudinal designs to understand its
                developmental trajectory with the goal of making clinically
                relevant predictions about individual children with TS.</p>

            <p>One of the major obstacles for MRI research, particularly in
                pediatric populations, is excessive head movement in the
                scanner. Even small amounts of motion can introduce systematic
                distortions in the data. While data processing methods can
                mitigate some of these effects, the most effective approaches
                result in significant data loss. Thus, we aim to test and
                improve strategies for reducing head motion in the scanner.
                Our recent work has tested the effects of movie watching and
                real-time motion feedback on in-scanner head motion in children.
                We also employ real-time quality control using a newly developed
                software, Framewise Integrated Real-Time MRI Monitoring
                (FIRMM).</p>
